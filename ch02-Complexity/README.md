# Time Complexity
is a measure of the time required to run an algorithm as the input size increases.

Time complexity is a high-level overview of performance. It doesn't judge the speed of the algorithm beyond the general ranking scheme.
This means that two algorithms can have the same time complexity, but one may still be faster than the other.


### Big O Notation
 used to represent various magnitudes of time complexity

### Constant Time - O(1)
 an algorithm that has the same running time regardless of the size of their input


### Linear Time - O(n)
 an algorithm whereas the amount of data increases, the running time increase by the same amount

### Quadratic Time - O(n^2)
is a time complexity algorithm that takes time proportional to the square of the input size. Most commonly referred to as an `n squared`

### Logarithmic Time - O(log n)
As the input data increases, the time it takes to execute the algorithm increase at a slow rate.

eg. Binary Search


### Quasilinear Time - O(n log n)
an algorithm which performs worse than the Linear Time, but better than Quadratic Time. So it sits somewhere in between Linear Time and Quadratic Time


# Space Complexity
is a measure of the resources required for the algorithm to run.
